## Methods

To conduct this analysis, Power BI resources were leveraged to create visualizations representing the following aspects:

1. **Visuals about the TOP3 Products:** Using metrics such as sales or profits, the three most relevant products for the company were identified and highlighted.

2. **Key countries in terms of sales and/or profit:** Through bar charts or maps, countries that significantly contribute to sales or profits were highlighted.

3. **Scatter plot on Units Sold and Sales per month:** This graph allows visualizing the relationship between units sold and sales over time, identifying possible patterns or correlations.

4. **Data grouping visuals:** Visualizations showing relevant data groupings were created, such as customer segments or product categories.

5. **Data compartmentalization visuals:** Utilizing resources such as slicers or filters, it was possible to allow users to explore the data in more detail, segmenting by different variables such as region, product category, among others.

## Results

After analyzing the data and creating the visualizations, several key insights were uncovered:

- The top three selling products are [list the products] and represent [percentage] of total sales.
- The countries contributing most to sales are [list the countries] and represent [percentage] of total sales.
- A positive correlation between units sold and sales was observed, indicating that higher unit sales result in increased sales volume.
- Customer segments [list the segments] exhibit distinct purchasing behaviors, suggesting the need for differentiated marketing strategies for each group.

## Conclusion

The utilization of Power BI for data analysis provided a clear and detailed view of the company's sales performance. The created visualizations enabled the identification of patterns, trends, and valuable insights for decision-making. It is recommended that the company utilize these insights to optimize its sales strategies, focusing on the most profitable products and countries, and effectively segmenting its target audience.

## Case Study

To illustrate the effectiveness of the insights derived from the Power BI analysis, consider the following scenario:

Company X, a global retailer, utilized the insights gained from the Power BI analysis to refine its marketing strategies. By focusing on the top-selling products and key countries identified in the analysis, Company X was able to tailor its marketing campaigns to target specific customer segments in those regions. As a result, sales increased by 15% within six months, leading to a substantial boost in profitability. This case study highlights the tangible impact of data-driven decision-making enabled by Power BI.
